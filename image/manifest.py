"""List everything a logical image ships, as a UAPI.16 File Manifest.

The format is an RFC7464 JSON-SEQ sequence: a root object naming the media type, then one object
per inode, each directory immediately followed by its own contents. Two consumers want this: a
comparison of the paths two images ship (a path in both a system extension and the /usr it merges
onto silently shadows an OS file), and per-image size accounting. Both need every inode type an OS
tree holds, so a type that cannot be listed is an error rather than an omission.

A driver writing a listing of what it is about to package imports this rather than running it: only
the driver holds the finished tree, and only it knows which paths of that tree its artifact carries.
`roots` is how it says so, and names stay relative to the image, so a listing reads as where each
path lands on a machine rather than where it sits inside one partition.
