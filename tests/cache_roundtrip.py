"""Prove the shared cache end to end: a real Buck publishes through the shim, and a cold one gets it back.

    buck run tine//tests:cache-roundtrip

Everything the shim does on its own is unit-tested in remote_cache/. What only a real build shows is
that `tine buck` starts and shares the shim, that Buck's client and the shim agree on the protocol,
and that a result one build published is a hit for a machine holding nothing but the bucket. So this
stands up a SeaweedFS bucket, points a `tine.local.toml` at it, builds the examples cold as a
builder, then cleans, stops the shim, drops its store, and builds again as a reader.

One example per supported component type (see SERVED), each checked through `what-ran`.

Runs in a dedicated isolation dir, to avoid messing up the developer's own build state.
