"""Assemble the vendored crate tree that a locked, offline cargo build reads.

Each crate directory carries a .cargo-checksum.json recording the tarball's hash and every unpacked
file's, which is how cargo satisfies itself that the tree matches the lock. The tarball's hash is
recomputed here from bytes buck already verified against the lock, so it necessarily equals the
lock's pin.

Only registry crates are vendored; a git dependency stays a git source, pointed at its fetched
repository instead (see build.py).
