"""Build a Rust project from source inside a box, against its vendored crate tree.

The build runs with no network: every registry crate is already unpacked, and pointing cargo's
crates-io source at that directory is what keeps it from consulting the registry index. Each git
source is replaced by the fetched repository itself, a file:// clone cargo takes its own checkout
from, insisting on the locked commit, so nothing has to be rewritten or re-verified here.
cargo-auditable wraps the build to record the crate graph in each binary, which is how the image's
SBOM learns what went into it.
