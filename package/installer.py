"""Run one native package installation against the root its spec names.

Every package system's installer answers the same request: a directory holding the exact package
closure, and either a fresh root to fill, a delta to persist over a lower stack, or a root the
caller has already mounted. Which of those it is, and how the root is mounted and captured, is
the same work whichever system fills it, so it happens here and the driver is left with the
transaction itself.
