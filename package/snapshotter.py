"""Pin one repository: its build metadata, and every package it currently serves.

Refresh runs a host-side fetch-and-parse step per repository, and whichever package system owns
it, that step answers the same request: the metadata a build materializes to make the repository
local again, and an inventory keyed by the content checksum every package is fetched by. Only how
a repository describes those is its own, so the fetching, the merge rule, the JSON and the
invocation happen here and a driver is left with its own metadata format.
