"""Bootstrap a root from a package system's own archives, before its package manager exists.

Every package system's bootstrap extractor answers the same request: a set of packages, or
directories of them, and a root to lay them down in. Which archive format that means opening is
the only part that differs, so the expansion, the ordering, the capture and the invocation happen
here and a driver is left with one package at a time.
