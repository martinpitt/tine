"""The transaction a planner writes and a package closure is selected from.

One schema, shared by every package system's planner, because the same Starlark reads all of
them: `select_package_artifacts` looks each entry up in its repository's pool by checksum, and a
committed box lock is one of these files kept verbatim. What differs between package systems
is how the closure is arrived at, not how it is described.
