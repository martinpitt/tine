"""Refresh pure catalog snapshots, then resolve box transactions against those pins.

With `--advance`, repositories pinned to a mirror that publishes snapshots first advance their
declaration to the newest one: an rpmrepo gateway enumerates them, the Arch Linux Archive publishes
a tree per day and records when it last finished one, and the Debian archive lists every timestamp
it holds. Repositories sharing one pin advance together, and rolling back means editing the pin.

Remote box-lock entries retain their package transports, so a repository's package pool keeps
the committed box available after its repodata advances.

A repository's declared signing keys are fetched once, by fingerprint, and the file is never
rewritten afterwards. Whether a file is the declared key is the build's check, with the package
system's own tools.

The host orchestrator discovers refresh targets and takes each result from the driver's stdout,
so refreshing and verifying run one command and only the host decides where an output belongs.
Nested Buck reuses the invoking daemon through the inherited isolation directory.
