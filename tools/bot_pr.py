"""Make one automatic change and open the pull request for it.

Only one run of each kind is ever in flight: while a pull request or a failure issue carrying the run's
label is open, this does nothing.

 - If the command fails without generating a commit, open an issue and pass on the failing exit code.
 - If the command fails after committing, open a draft PR with a note, and pass on the failing exit code.
 - Otherwise, open a regular PR and exit zero.

This is usually being called with the default GITHUB_TOKEN, which will not trigger further actions, in
particular tests. So it pushes with the deploy key the checkout set up (see tools/setup_deploy_key.py),
and pushes the branch once more after opening the pull request, to start its CI.

Everything a workflow decides is an option, so that `--help` is the whole contract. The rest comes from
what Actions sets around the run: GITHUB_SERVER_URL and GITHUB_RUN_ID to link back to it, and
GITHUB_REF_NAME as the branch the pull request goes against.

Needs only git, gh and a host python: it runs before the project's build system has fetched anything.
