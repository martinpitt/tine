"""What the shim keeps locally: blobs on disk, results and provenance beside them.

On disk, because a shim outlives the build that filled it: Buck2 declares an artifact in one build and
fetches it in a later one, and a real cacheable set does not fit in a process anyway. On disk means
bounded, and bounded means a blob can be evicted while the bundle it came from is still in the bucket.
Buck2 can then ask for it by digest alone, with no result to say where to look, so every blob remembers
which bundle carried it, and that row outlives the bytes: it is what makes a second fetch possible
instead of a failed build.

Blobs are kept one per file rather than as the bundles the bucket holds, because that is the shape
of every request: Buck2 uploads, asks for and reads blobs by digest, never by bundle, and a bundle
only comes into being when a result is published. It also stores a blob once however many bundles
carry it, evicts at the granularity Buck2 reads at, and serves a ranged read straight from a file.
Everything else is a row: pointers are a few hundred bytes and provenance is two hashes.

Nothing here is trusted for having been written by us. The directory is shared between every build
on the machine and outlives all of them, so a pointer is kept as the signed bytes the bucket held and
is verified again on every hit, the leaf certificates that takes are kept beside it, and a blob is
hashed against its name on every read. What the store adds is speed, never trust.
