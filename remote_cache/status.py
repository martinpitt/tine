"""Something to ask a running shim.

The shim is started in the background by whichever `tine buck` first needs it, so a later command
holds no handle to the process. Before starting another, the launcher has to know whether one already
serves the store, and `tine cache-status` wants its counters; a log can say that a shim started, not
that it is still there. So a running shim answers JSON over a unix socket, which needs no port and no
address to agree on.

The socket is named after the store rather than placed inside it. A unix socket path has about a
hundred bytes to spend, which a store under a cache directory several levels down can exceed on its
own, so a caller says which store it means and both sides derive the same short name. It lives in
the runtime directory when there is one, because that is per-user, private, and cleaned up on
logout.

The socket existing and accepting is itself the liveness answer: it goes away with the process.
