"""The CPU architectures tine builds for, and how each consumer spells them.

Everything with its own naming schema reads it from this table:

- `config`: the Buck2 prelude's constraint value, which `select()` keys on
- `efi`: ukify's `--efi-arch`, which also names the boot stubs and systemd-boot
- `systemd`: the `%a` specifier, which names published artifacts
- `rpm`, `pacman`, `deb`: the package system's own name, in its metadata and its mirrors' layout
