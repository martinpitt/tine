"""Install an exact package set into a fresh, layered, or already-mounted root.

The same driver bootstraps boxes, assembles buildroots, and extends image layers. `plan.py` has
already chosen the exact packages, so APT gets these packages and no repository. APT decides the
order and runs dpkg. Maintainer scripts therefore run as on a real system, and dpkg configures a
pre-dependency before it unpacks the package that needs it.

For a fresh root, the driver extracts every package before it runs APT. dpkg cannot defer a
`preinst` script, so the first `preinst` that calls a shell would fail in a root without a shell.
debootstrap extracts the packages first for the same reason.
