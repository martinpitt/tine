"""Verify upstream debs against the signed Release of a repository.

Debian signs the Release and nothing else. The Release lists the checksum of every index, and an
index lists the checksum of every package. The verifier follows this chain. sqv checks the
signature of the pinned Release against the declared keys. The Release must name the suite of the
directory that it is in, and it must list the pinned index at the path of the index. The index
must list each selected package. A committed lock retains the Release and the index that it was
resolved against. The retained files verify a package that the pinned index no longer describes.

The keys of the archive sign the Release directly, so sqv reads the declared key files as they
are, and no keyring is built.
