"""Pin the Packages index of a Debian repository and the packages that the index describes.

A Debian archive has a chain of checksums. The `Release` of a suite lists the checksum of every
index, and each index lists the checksum of every package. The snapshot follows the chain once, at
refresh time. It pins the one index that a solve reads, and it writes an inventory of the packages.
Both pinned files keep the path that the mirror serves them under. `verify.py` checks the signed
`Release` against these paths: the suite must match the directory, and the `Release` must list the
index at its path.

The snapshot pins the signed `InRelease` next to the index but does not verify the signature.
Verification needs sqv, and the host only provides a pinned Buck and a pinned Python. So the
snapshot reads the unsigned `Release` from the same directory. At build time, `verify.py` follows
the chain again from the pinned `InRelease`, and fails if that does not list the pinned index.
