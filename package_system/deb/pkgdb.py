"""Copy the dpkg database out of a logical image as a separate, trimmed artifact.

The image does not ship the database, and SBOM tools and security scanners need it. The dpkg
database is the file `status`, which describes every installed package, and the directory `info`
with several files per package. The output is a reproducible tar of `status` and `info`.

From `info`, only the `.list` files are kept, which name the files that a package owns. The
maintainer scripts are code of the package and describe nothing. The `.md5sums` files are large,
and only dpkg reads them, to verify an installed tree.
