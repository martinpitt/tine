"""Build the keyring that verifies an alpm repository's packages.

Arch signs each package with an individual packager's key and vouches for those keys through
certifications by its main keys, all shipped together in `archlinux-keyring`. The declared signing
keys are the main keys. The box's copy of that package supplies the packagers' keys and the
certifications, and a packager's key counts once three declared main keys certify it: pacman-key's
trust model, with the catalog rather than the package deciding which main keys count.
