"""Copy the alpm database out of a logical image as a separate, trimmed artifact.

Useful as a basis for SBOM creation and security scanners. The database is not shipped in
the image, so capture it as a separate artifact. alpm keeps a directory of per-package
entries rather than a database file, so the output is a reproducible archive of it.

Each entry's `mtree` is dropped: it is a manifest of the files the package shipped, which
pacman alone reads to verify an installed tree, and it is the largest part of an entry after
the file list. What identifies the package (`desc`) and what it owns (`files`) both stay.
