"""Copy the rpm database out of a logical image as a separate, trimmed artifact.

Useful as a basis for SBOM creation and security scanners. The database is not shipped in
the image, so capture it as a separate artifact. rpm keeps one sqlite database, so the
output is a copy of that file.

The copy is trimmed to the ``Packages`` table alone: rpm's path/dependency lookup indexes
(Basenames, Providename, ...) are used only by rpm itself, dropping them roughly halves
the size.

The in-image database is already journal-parked at install time (install.py:parkdb); this
re-parks the copy so DROP/VACUUM leaves no -wal/-shm sidecar beside the declared output.
