# A package database is captured as one file, named after the format the package system keeps it in.
# rpm keeps one sqlite database, so the file is that database. alpm keeps a directory with one entry
# per package, so the file is a tar of the directory. dpkg keeps a status file and a directory with
# files per package, so the file is a tar of the status file and the directory. The caller passes
# the expected path, format and package system. alpm and dpkg share a format, so the test checks
# the content by package system.
